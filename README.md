# GPU vs CPU | Machine learning

Comparison between my CPU and my GPU, with an application on machine learning.  
Note that this comparison was done on my own computer, results may vary from one configuration to another.

Several comparisons are performed: array incrementing, matrix multiplication, and training a VGG deep learning model to classify CIFAR-10.
